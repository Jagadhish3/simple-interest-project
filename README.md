Where:

P = Principal Amount

R = Rate of Interest (per annum)

T = Time (in years)

Features

Takes user input for Principal, Rate of Interest, and Time.

Calculates Simple Interest.

Displays both Simple Interest and Total Amount (Principal + Interest).

Beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and run on any C++ compiler.

Sample Output
=== Simple Interest Calculator ===
Enter Principal Amount: 1000
Enter Rate of Interest (in %): 5
Enter Time (in years): 2

Simple Interest = 100
Total Amount (Principal + Interest) = 1100
